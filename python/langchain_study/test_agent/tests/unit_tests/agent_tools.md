| 用户工具 | tavily_search | A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. It not only retrieves URLs and snippets, but offers advanced search depths, domain management, time range filters, and image search, this tool delivers real-time, accurate, and citation-backed results.Input should be a search query. |
|  | get_weather | 查询指定城市的天气信息。<br><br>Args:<br>    city: 城市名称（必需）<br>    unit: 温度单位，支持 "celsius"（摄氏度）或 "fahrenheit"（华氏度），默认为 "celsius"<br><br>Returns:<br>    天气信息字符串，包含温度、天气状况、湿度、风速等信息 |
| 文件系统工具 | ls | Lists all files in a directory.<br><br>This is useful for exploring the filesystem and finding the right file to read or edit.<br>You should almost ALWAYS use this tool before using the read_file or edit_file tools. |
|  | read_file | Reads a file from the filesystem.<br><br>Assume this tool is able to read all files. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.<br><br>Usage:<br>- By default, it reads up to 100 lines starting from the beginning of the file<br>- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow<br>  - First scan: read_file(path, limit=100) to see file structure<br>  - Read more sections: read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines<br>  - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing<br>- Specify offset and limit: read_file(path, offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines<br>- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1<br>- Lines longer than 5,000 characters will be split into multiple lines with continuation markers (e.g., 5.1, 5.2, etc.). When you specify a limit, these continuation lines count towards the limit.<br>- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.<br>- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.<br>- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are returned as multimodal image content blocks (see https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal).<br><br>For image tasks:<br>- Use `read_file(file_path=...)` for `.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.webp`<br>- Do NOT use `offset`/`limit` for images (pagination is text-only)<br>- If image details were compacted from history, call `read_file` again on the same path<br><br>- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it. |
|  | write_file | Writes to a new file in the filesystem.<br><br>Usage:<br>- The write_file tool will create the a new file.<br>- Prefer to edit existing files (with the edit_file tool) over creating new ones when possible. |
|  | edit_file | Performs exact string replacements in files.<br><br>Usage:<br>- You must read the file before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file first.<br>- When editing, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) from the read output. Never include line number prefixes in old_string or new_string.<br>- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.<br>- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. |
|  | glob | Find files matching a glob pattern.<br><br>Supports standard glob patterns: `*` (any characters), `**` (any directories), `?` (single character).<br>Returns a list of absolute file paths that match the pattern.<br><br>Examples:<br>- `**/*.py` - Find all Python files<br>- `*.txt` - Find all text files in root<br>- `/subdir/**/*.md` - Find all markdown files under /subdir |
|  | grep | Search for a text pattern across files.<br><br>Searches for literal text (not regex) and returns matching files or content based on output_mode.<br>Special characters like parentheses, brackets, pipes, etc. are treated as literal characters, not regex operators.<br><br>Examples:<br>- Search all files: `grep(pattern="TODO")`<br>- Search Python files only: `grep(pattern="import", glob="*.py")`<br>- Show matching lines: `grep(pattern="error", output_mode="content")`<br>- Search for code with special chars: `grep(pattern="def __init__(self):")` |
|  | execute | Executes a shell command in an isolated sandbox environment.<br><br>Usage:<br>Executes a given command in the sandbox environment with proper handling and security measures.<br>Before executing the command, please follow these steps:<br>1. Directory Verification:<br>   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the ls tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location<br>   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use ls to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory<br>2. Command Execution:<br>   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")<br>   - Examples of proper quoting:<br>     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)<br>     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)<br>     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)<br>     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)<br>   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command<br>   - Capture the output of the command<br>Usage notes:<br>  - Commands run in an isolated sandbox environment<br>  - Returns combined stdout/stderr output with exit code<br>  - If the output is very large, it may be truncated<br>  - For long-running commands, use the optional timeout parameter to override the default timeout (e.g., execute(command="make build", timeout=300))<br>  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like find and grep. Instead use the grep, glob tools to search. You MUST avoid read tools like cat, head, tail, and use read_file to read files.<br>  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings)<br>    - Use '&&' when commands depend on each other (e.g., "mkdir dir && cd dir")<br>    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail<br>  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd<br><br>Examples:<br>  Good examples:<br>    - execute(command="pytest /foo/bar/tests")<br>    - execute(command="python /path/to/script.py")<br>    - execute(command="npm install && npm test")<br>    - execute(command="make build", timeout=300)<br><br>  Bad examples (avoid these):<br>    - execute(command="cd /foo/bar && pytest tests")  # Use absolute path instead<br>    - execute(command="cat file.txt")  # Use read_file tool instead<br>    - execute(command="find . -name '*.py'")  # Use glob tool instead<br>    - execute(command="grep -r 'pattern' .")  # Use grep tool instead<br><br>Note: This tool is only available if the backend supports execution (SandboxBackendProtocol).<br>If execution is not supported, the tool will return an error message. |
| 系统工具 | write_todos | Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.<br><br>Only use this tool if you think it will be helpful in staying organized. If the user's request is trivial and takes less than 3 steps, it is better to NOT use this tool and just do the task directly.<br><br>## When to Use This Tool<br>Use this tool in these scenarios:<br><br>1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions<br>2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations<br>3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list<br>4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)<br>5. The plan may need future revisions or updates based on results from the first few steps<br><br>## How to Use This Tool<br>1. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work.<br>2. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation.<br>3. You can also update future tasks, such as deleting them if they are no longer necessary, or adding new tasks that are necessary. Don't change previously completed tasks.<br>4. You can make several updates to the todo list at once. For example, when you complete a task, you can mark the next task you need to start as in_progress.<br><br>## When NOT to Use This Tool<br>It is important to skip using this tool when:<br>1. There is only a single, straightforward task<br>2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no benefit<br>3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps<br>4. The task is purely conversational or informational<br><br>## Task States and Management<br><br>1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:<br>   - pending: Task not yet started<br>   - in_progress: Currently working on (you can have multiple tasks in_progress at a time if they are not related to each other and can be run in parallel)<br>   - completed: Task finished successfully<br><br>2. **Task Management**:<br>   - Update task status in real-time as you work<br>   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)<br>   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones<br>   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely<br>   - IMPORTANT: When you write this todo list, you should mark your first task (or tasks) as in_progress immediately!.<br>   - IMPORTANT: Unless all tasks are completed, you should always have at least one task in_progress to show the user that you are working on something.<br><br>3. **Task Completion Requirements**:<br>   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it<br>   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress<br>   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved<br>   - Never mark a task as completed if:<br>     - There are unresolved issues or errors<br>     - Work is partial or incomplete<br>     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion<br>     - You couldn't find necessary resources or dependencies<br>     - Quality standards haven't been met<br><br>4. **Task Breakdown**:<br>   - Create specific, actionable items<br>   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps<br>   - Use clear, descriptive task names<br><br>Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully<br>Remember: If you only need to make a few tool calls to complete a task, and it is clear what you need to do, it is better to just do the task directly and NOT call this tool at all. |
|  | task | Launch an ephemeral subagent to handle complex, multi-step independent tasks with isolated context windows.<br><br>Available agent types and the tools they have access to:<br>- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for files and content, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. This agent has access to all tools as the main agent.<br><br>When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.<br><br>## Usage notes:<br>1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses<br>2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.<br>3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.<br>4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted<br>5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent<br>6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.<br>7. When only the general-purpose agent is provided, you should use it for all tasks. It is great for isolating context and token usage, and completing specific, complex tasks, as it has all the same capabilities as the main agent.<br><br>### Example usage of the general-purpose agent:<br><br><example_agent_descriptions><br>"general-purpose": use this agent for general purpose tasks, it has access to all tools as the main agent.<br></example_agent_descriptions><br><br><example><br>User: "I want to conduct research on the accomplishments of Lebron James, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant, and then compare them."<br>Assistant: *Uses the task tool in parallel to conduct isolated research on each of the three players*<br>Assistant: *Synthesizes the results of the three isolated research tasks and responds to the User*<br><commentary><br>Research is a complex, multi-step task in it of itself.<br>The research of each individual player is not dependent on the research of the other players.<br>The assistant uses the task tool to break down the complex objective into three isolated tasks.<br>Each research task only needs to worry about context and tokens about one player, then returns synthesized information about each player as the Tool Result.<br>This means each research task can dive deep and spend tokens and context deeply researching each player, but the final result is synthesized information, and saves us tokens in the long run when comparing the players to each other.<br></commentary><br></example><br><br><example><br>User: "Analyze a single large code repository for security vulnerabilities and generate a report."<br>Assistant: *Launches a single `task` subagent for the repository analysis*<br>Assistant: *Receives report and integrates results into final summary*<br><commentary><br>Subagent is used to isolate a large, context-heavy task, even though there is only one. This prevents the main thread from being overloaded with details.<br>If the user then asks followup questions, we have a concise report to reference instead of the entire history of analysis and tool calls, which is good and saves us time and money.<br></commentary><br></example><br><br><example><br>User: "Schedule two meetings for me and prepare agendas for each."<br>Assistant: *Calls the task tool in parallel to launch two `task` subagents (one per meeting) to prepare agendas*<br>Assistant: *Returns final schedules and agendas*<br><commentary><br>Tasks are simple individually, but subagents help silo agenda preparation.<br>Each subagent only needs to worry about the agenda for one meeting.<br></commentary><br></example><br><br><example><br>User: "I want to order a pizza from Dominos, order a burger from McDonald's, and order a salad from Subway."<br>Assistant: *Calls tools directly in parallel to order a pizza from Dominos, a burger from McDonald's, and a salad from Subway*<br><commentary><br>The assistant did not use the task tool because the objective is super simple and clear and only requires a few trivial tool calls.<br>It is better to just complete the task directly and NOT use the `task`tool.<br></commentary><br></example><br><br>### Example usage with custom agents:<br><br><example_agent_descriptions><br>"content-reviewer": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents<br>"greeting-responder": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke<br>"research-analyst": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics<br></example_agent_description><br><br><example><br>user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"<br>assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime<br>assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime<br>assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:<br><code><br>function isPrime(n) {<br>  if (n <= 1) return false<br>  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {<br>    if (n % i === 0) return false<br>  }<br>  return true<br>}<br></code><br><commentary><br>Since significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work<br></commentary><br>assistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code<br>assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent<br></example><br><br><example><br>user: "Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?"<br><commentary><br>This is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis<br></commentary><br>assistant: I'll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.
